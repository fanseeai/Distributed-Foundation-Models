# Embracing Distributed Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Learning

## Introduction

As we navigate the complexities of modern data processing, the limitations of monolithic models are becoming increasingly apparent, particularly in the context of training multi-modal models. The reliance on centralized data centers with extreme performance capabilities is reaching critical levels, exacerbated by the challenges of processing video and audio data. However, a paradigm shift towards a distributed foundation model offers a viable solution. This position paper advocates for the feasibility and advantages of learning occurring through nodes within a distributed system exchanging messages via compressed communication channels, particularly in the context of multi-modal learning.

## Motivation

The current reliance on monolithic models presents significant challenges, especially as we progress towards training multi-modal models. Processing video and audio data requires immense computational power, leading to inevitable compute bottlenecks. Distributed learning, on the other hand, offers a more natural and scalable approach, mirroring the collaborative nature of human learning. Furthermore, recent advancements in compression techniques, as illustrated by the principle of "Attention is All You Need", underscore the potential for compressed communication channels to facilitate efficient and scalable learning processes.

## Proposal

Our proposal posits that learning can feasibly occur through nodes within a distributed system exchanging messages via compressed communication channels. By decentralizing the learning process and leveraging distributed systems, we can overcome the limitations of centralized models, particularly in the realm of multi-modal learning. Compressed communication channels serve as the backbone of this approach, enabling collaborative learning through critical information exchange among distributed nodes. Learning is achieved by striving for consensus among nodes, mimicking the collaborative nature of human learning.

## Example: Implementing Diffusion via Distributed Computing

There exists a compelling analogy between denoising within the diffusion model and the pursuit of consensus in distributed systems. The process of learning a distribution within the diffusion model mirrors the algorithmic approach to seeking consensus in distributed systems. In this context, the generalized consensus effectively represents the distribution to be learned. Consider each node within the distributed system as a state machine starting with an identical image and gradually adding noise until each node achieves Gaussian noise. The reverse process involves restoring the image, achieving consensus among the nodes.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the distributed foundation model, facilitated by compressed communication channels, holds immense promise for revolutionizing multi-modal learning paradigms. By decentralizing the learning process and embracing distributed systems, we can address the pressing challenges posed by centralized models, particularly in processing video and audio data.
