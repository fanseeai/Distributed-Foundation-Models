## Leveraging Distributed Foundation Model for Attaining System 2 Thinking:

System 2 thinking is a concept from Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory, which proposes two ways our minds process information:

- System 1: Fast, automatic, unconscious, and emotional. This is our gut instinct, operating on intuition and learned heuristics.
- System 2: Slow, effortful, logical, and deliberate. This is the conscious reasoning part of our brain, used for complex problem-solving and critical thinking.

System 2 thinking is crucial for complex decision-making, critical thinking, and tasks requiring careful analysis. While contemporary large language models (LLMs) predominantly excel in System 1 thinking, the distributed foundation model presents a distinctive opportunity to bolster deliberative processes, synonymous with System 2 cognition.

The distributed foundation model's architecture encourages collaboration among interconnected nodes, facilitating efficient deliberation. A trained leader node can coordinate this process, resembling an agentic workflow.

While a distributed foundation model is inspired by the collaborative nature of human learning, it is possible that our individual mental model itself also operates similarly to a distributed system, with a leader node orchestrating follower nodes toward system 2 thinking. For instance, some nodes may be specialized in visual tasks, but each node possesses basic abstract reasoning capabilities allowing them to work together to accomplish more complex tasks. The typical leader-follower social structure among intelligent beings likely arises from the projection of this internal mental model onto a group. Moreover, a distributed model offers the advantage of minimal downtime and facilitates rolling updates, likely evolutionarily favored. Notably, a distributed mental model mirrors the cellular organization of multi-cellular organisms, characterized by specialized cells collaborating to sustain functions and adapt to environmental changes, with cellular signaling playing a pivotal role, supporting the pervasive nature of distributed systems in both biological and cognitive realms.

Nodes are all you need.
