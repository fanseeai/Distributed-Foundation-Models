## Leveraging Distributed Foundation Model for Attaining System 2 Thinking:

System 2 thinking is a concept from Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory, which proposes two ways our minds process information:

- System 1: Fast, automatic, unconscious, and emotional. This is our gut instinct, operating on intuition and learned heuristics.
- System 2: Slow, effortful, logical, and deliberate. This is the conscious reasoning part of our brain, used for complex problem-solving and critical thinking.

System 2 thinking is crucial for complex decision-making, critical thinking, and tasks requiring careful analysis. While contemporary large language models (LLMs) predominantly excel in System 1 thinking, the distributed foundation model presents a distinctive opportunity to bolster deliberative processes, synonymous with System 2 cognition.

The distributed foundation model's architecture encourages collaboration among interconnected nodes, facilitating efficient deliberation. A trained leader node can coordinate this process, resembling an agentic workflow, ultimately converting time into meaningful productivity.
